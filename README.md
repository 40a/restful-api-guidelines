# Zalando's Restful API Guidelines

Latest published version: [HTML](http://zalando.github.io/restful-api-guidelines) | [PDF](http://zalando.github.io/restful-api-guidelines/guidelines.pdf)

Purpose
-------
All Zalando APIs should look like they were designed by one team. This pushes adoption of our APIs and lowers effort for clients to use them properly. For that, we are constantly working on decent set of rules and best practices in form of these guidelines to build great APIs.

Usage
-----
We encourage our teams to challenge their APIs according to these guidelines. Feel free to use them as a guidance for your APIs.

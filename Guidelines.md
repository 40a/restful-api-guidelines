[M] API First: Define APIs using  Swagger YAML or JSON

API First is one of our architecture principles, as per our Architecture Rules of Play.
Define, document and review your APIs before delivering them (also see API review procedure). 

[S] Provide External Documentation

In addition to defining the API with Swagger, it’s good practice to provide documentation that
describes the API’s scope and purpose; architecture and use-case context (including figures);
sequence flows; edge cases and possible error situations, etc. Include a link to this documentation
using the “externalDocs” property in your RESTful API Swagger definition and post it online on
GitHub Enterprise pages, on specific team web servers, or as a Google doc.
